Description:
	** This file contains a bunch of options that control the build.bat.
	** This file is both a C header file that can be #included from a .c file,
	** and it is also scraped by the build.bat to extract values to change the work it performs.
	** Because it is scraped, and not parsed with the full C language spec, we must
	** be careful to keep this file very simple and not introduce any syntax that
	** would confuse the scraper when it's searching for values
