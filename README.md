# Handmade Skill Tree
A graphical skill tree (think video game skill tree) to help track the process of discovering and learning from Handmade projects. This version is based on PigCore ([previous versions](https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/HandmadeSkillTree) were in [Pig Engine](https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/PigEngine) and [Orca](https://orca-app.dev/index.html))
